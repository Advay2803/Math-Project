# Math-Project
This repository will contain all the data and the code related to the math project.

Here the relation between the total number of covid cases in the counties of Pennsylvania and  the population density, air quality index and its interation is determined.

The model is as followed:

For Counties of Pennsylvania,

Total number of covid cases = A * (Population density) + B * (Air quality Index) + C * (Population density * Air quality Index) + D

The data is beinig analysed statistically on python code by t-test and p-value.

Also, these parameters are determined in the python code.

Here the AQI signifies the amount oif pollution in tje region. This AQI value is a annual median AQI value for the particular county in Pennsylvania.
Whereasa, the population density accounts for the number of people living in the specific region that affects the COVID cases.

The question are as followed:

Q1. Are the people living in county with higher population density affects the COVID infection?

Q2. Does the area with higher AQI affect the COVID cases in that region?

Q3. Do people with less population density and less AQI have less covid infection ?

Q4. How is the low AQI and population density related?
