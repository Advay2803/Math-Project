# Math-Project
This repository will contain all the data and the code related to the math project.

Here the relation between the total number of covid cases in the counties of Pennsylvania and  the population density, air quality index and its interation is determined.

The model is as followed:

For Counties of Pennsylvania,

Total number of covid cases = A * (Population density) + B * (Air quality Index) + C * (Population density * Air quality Index) + D

The data is beinig analysed statistically on python code by t-test and p-value.

Also, these parameters are determined in the python code.

Here the AQI signifies the amount oif pollution in tje region. This AQI value is a annual median AQI value for the particular county in Pennsylvania.
Whereasa, the population density accounts for the number of people living in the specific region that affects the COVID cases.

The question are as followed:

Q1. Does population density affect the COVID infection?

Q2. Does the AQI affect the COVID cases?

Q3. What is the combine effect of AQI and  Population Density on COVID cases?

Q4. How does the interaction of parameter affect?
